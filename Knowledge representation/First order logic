For all x (PR(x) and D(x) and S(x) --> PR(X) and T(x))

3. Sorted organic dustbin goes to organic truck
For all x (O(x) and D(x) and S(x) --> O(X) and T(x))

4. Sorted glass dustbin goes to glass truck
For all x (G(x) and D(x) and S(x) --> G(X) and T(x))

5. Any dustbin not sorted goes to waste truck
For all x (D(x) and (not S(x)) --> W(x) and T(x))
