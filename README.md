# Garbage truck project

The task of an inteligent garbage truck (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_truck) is to
autonomously gather waste from dustbins. The truck should recognize the types of dustbins, look
inside the dustbins and check if the garbage is correctly sorted, empty the bins, move the waste to
the landfill and offload it in a suitable place.
